  - title: "(1) Dimension Estimation"
    desc: >
      Intrinsic dimension estimation algorithms try to estimate the rank/dimension of low-dimensional
      structure that is embedded in high-dimensional space.

  - title: "(2) Dimension Reduction"
    desc: >
      Functions below are finding low-dimensional embedding of the observed data
      according to the principle upon which each method is relied. Methods can be
      categorized as **linear** and **nonlinear** methods. The former class of methods explicitly finds
      a projection matrix while the latter does not.
