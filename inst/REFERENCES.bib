	abstract = {Bayesian nonparametrics has grown tremendously in the last three decades, especially in the last few years. This book is the first systematic treatment of Bayesian nonparametric methods and the theory behind them. While the book is of special interest to Bayesians, it will also appeal to statisticians in general because Bayesian nonparametrics offers a whole continuous spectrum of robust alternatives to purely parametric and purely nonparametric methods of classical statistics. The book is primarily aimed at graduate students and can be used as the text for a graduate course in Bayesian nonparametrics. Though the emphasis of the book is on nonparametrics, there is a substantial chapter on asymptotics of classical Bayesian parametric models. Jayanta Ghosh has been Director and Jawaharlal Nehru Professor at the Indian Statistical Institute and President of the International Statistical Institute. He is currently professor of statistics at Purdue University. He has been editor of Sankhya and served on the editorial boards of several journals including the Annals of Statistics. Apart from Bayesian analysis, his interests include asymptotics, stochastic modeling, high dimensional model selection, reliability and survival analysis and bioinformatics. R.V. Ramamoorthi is professor at the Department of Statistics and Probability at Michigan State University. He has published papers in the areas of sufficiency invariance, comparison of experiments, nonparametric survival analysis and Bayesian analysis. In addition to Bayesian nonparametrics, he is currently interested in Bayesian networks and graphical models. He is on the editorial board of Sankhya.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is characterized by increased and sustained emotional reactivity, which has been linked to sustained amygdala activity. It is also characterized by disruptions in executive control, linked to abnormal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) function. These mechanisms have been hypothesized to interact in depression. This study explored relationships between amygdala and DLPFC activity during emotional and cognitive information processing in unipolar depression.
METHOD: Twenty-seven unmedicated patients with DSM-IV unipolar major depressive disorder and 25 never-depressed healthy control subjects completed tasks requiring executive control (digit sorting) and emotional information processing (personal relevance rating of words) during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessment.
RESULTS: Relative to control subjects, depressed subjects displayed sustained amygdala reactivity on the emotional tasks and decreased DLPFC activity on the digit-sorting task. Decreased relationships between the time-series of amygdala and DLPFC activity were observed within tasks in depression, but different depressed individuals showed each type of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Depression is associated with increased limbic activity in response to emotional information processing and decreased DLPFC activity in response to cognitive tasks though these may reflect separate mechanisms. Depressed individuals also display decreased relationships between amygdala and DLPFC activity, potentially signifying decreased functional relationships among these structures.},

The text includes brief introductory and review material, and then proceeds through regression and modeling for the first half, and through ANOVA and Experimental Design in the second half. All topics are presented in a precise and clear style supported with solved examples, numbered formulae, graphic illustrations, and "Notes" to provide depth and statistical accuracy and precision. Applications used within the text and the hallmark problems, exercises, and projects are drawn from virtually all disciplines and fields providing motivation for students in virtually any college. The Fifth edition provides an increased use of computing and graphical analysis throughout, without sacrificing concepts or rigor. In general, the 5e uses larger data sets in examples and exercises, and where methods can be automated within software without loss of understanding, it is so done.},

	abstract = {Linear registration and motion correction are important components of structural and functional brain image analysis. Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.},

Regions of the sensorimotor cortex that were activated secondary to hand movement were identified using functional MRI methodology (FMRI). Time courses of low frequency ({\textless} 0.1 Hz) fluctuations in resting brain were observed to have a high degree of temporal correlation (P {\textless} 10(-3)) within these regions and also with time courses in several other regions that can be associated with motor function. It is concluded that correlation of low frequency fluctuations, which may arise from fluctuations in blood oxygenation or flow, is a manifestation of functional connectivity of the brain.},

The result is a complete labeling of cortical sulci and gyri. Examples are given from two different training sets generated using different neuroanatomical conventions, illustrating the flexibility of the algorithm.

	abstract = {Understanding functional connectivity within the brain is crucial to understanding neural function; even the simplest cognitive operations are supported by highly distributed neural circuits. We developed a novel method to measure task-related functional interactions between neural regions by applying coherence and partial coherence analyses to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Coherence and partial coherence are spectral measures that estimate the linear time-invariant (LTI) relationship between time series. They can be used to generate maps of task-specific connectivity associated with seed regions of interest (ROIs). These maps may then be compared across tasks, revealing nodes with task-related changes of connectivity to the seed ROI. To validate the method, we applied it to an event-related fMRI data set acquired while subjects performed two sequence tapping tasks, one of which required more bimanual coordination. Areas showing increased functional connectivity with both tasks were the same as those showing increased activity. Furthermore, though there were no significant differences in mean activity between the two tasks, significant increases in interhemispheric coherence were found between the primary motor (M1) and premotor (PM) regions for the task requiring more bimanual coordination. This increase in interhemispheric connectivity is supported by other brain imaging techniques as well as patient studies.},

Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a general multivariate approach to the analysis of functional imaging studies. This analysis uses standard multivariate techniques to make statistical inferences about activation effects and to describe the important features of these effects. More specifically, the proposed analysis uses multivariate analysis of covariance (ManCova) with Wilk's lambda to test for specific effects of interest (e.g., differences among activation conditions), and canonical variates analysis (CVA) to characterize differential responses in terms of distributed brain systems. The data are subject to ManCova after transformation using their principal components or eigenimages. After significance of the activation effect has been assessed, underlying changes are described in terms of canonical images. Canonical images are like eigenimages but take explicit account of the effects of error or noise. The generality of this approach is assured by the general linear model used in the ManCova. The design and inferences sought are embodied in the design matrix and can, in principle, accommodate most parametric statistical analyses. This multivariate analysis may provide a statistical approach to PET activation studies that 1) complements univariate approaches like statistical parametric mapping, and 2) may facilitate the extension of existing multivariate techniques, like the scaled subprofile model and eigenimage analysis, to include hypothesis testing and statistical inference.},

	volume = {112},
	issn = {1388-2457},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mutual information provides a measure of both the linear and nonlinear statistical dependencies between two time series. Cross-mutual information (CMI) is used to quantify the information transmitted from one time series to another, while auto mutual information (AMI) in a time series estimates how much on average the value of the time series can be predicted from values of the time series at preceding points. The aim of this study is to assess information transmission between different cortical areas in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients by estimating the average CMI between EEG electrodes.
METHODS: We recorded the EEG from 16 scale electrodes in 15 AD patients and 15 age-matched normal controls, and estimated the local, distant, and interhemispheric CMIs of the EEG in both groups. The rate of decrease (with increasing delay) of the AMI of the EEG was also measured to evaluate the complexity of the EEG in AD patients.
RESULTS: The local CMI in AD subjects was lower than that in normal controls, especially over frontal and antero-temporal regions. A prominent decrease in information transmission between distant electrodes in the right hemisphere and between corresponding interhemispheric electrodes was detected in the AD patients. In addition, the AMIs throughout the cerebrums of the AD patients decreased significantly more slowly with delay than did the AMIs of normal controls.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with previous findings that suggest the association of EEG abnormalities in AD patients with functional impairment of information transmission in long cortico-cortical connections.},

Computational issues, though challenging, are no longer intractable. All that is needed is an entry point: this intelligent book is the perfect guide to what can seem a forbidding landscape. Tutorial chapters by Ghosal, Lijoi and PrÃ¼nster, Teh and Jordan, and Dunson advance from theory, to basic models and hierarchical modeling, to applications and implementation, particularly in computer science and biostatistics. These are complemented by companion chapters by the editors and Griffin and Quintana, providing additional models, examining computational issues, identifying future growth areas, and giving links to related topics. This coherent text gives ready access both to underlying principles and to state-of-the-art practice. Specific examples are drawn from information retrieval, NLP, machine vision, computational biology, biostatistics, and bioinformatics"--Provided by publisher},

The text emphasizes methods that are most commonly used in practical application, such as classical inferences for two- and three-way contingency tables, logistic regression, loglinear models, models for multinomial (nominal and ordinal) responses, and methods for repeated measurement and other forms of clustered, correlated response data. Chapter headings remain essentially with the exception of a new one on Bayesian inference for parametric models. Other major changes include an expansion of clustered data, new research on analysis of data sets with robust variables, extensive discussions of ordinal data, more on interpretation, and additional exercises throughout the book.

	abstract = {"Due to advances in sensor, storage, and networking technologies, data is being generated on a daily basis at an ever-increasing pace in a wide range of applications, including cloud computing, mobile Internet, and medical imaging. This large multidimensional data requires more efficient dimensionality reduction schemes than the traditional techniques. Addressing this need, multilinear subspace learning (MSL) reduces the dimensionality of big data directly from its natural multidimensional representation, a tensor. Multilinear Subspace Learning: Dimensionality Reduction of Multidimensional Data gives a comprehensive introduction to both theoretical and practical aspects of MSL for the dimensionality reduction of multidimensional data based on tensors. It covers the fundamentals, algorithms, and applications of MSL. Emphasizing essential concepts and system-level perspectives, the authors provide a foundation for solving many of today's most interesting and challenging problems in big multidimensional data processing. They trace the history of MSL, detail recent advances, and explore future developments and emerging applications.The book follows a unifying MSL framework formulation to systematically derive representative MSL algorithms. It describes various applications of the algorithms, along with their pseudocode. Implementation tips help practitioners in further development, evaluation, and application. The book also provides researchers with useful theoretical information on big multidimensional data in machine learning and pattern recognition.

It comprises of regression and classification tasks as well as dimension reduction techniques and modeling tools. The underlying assumption of all PLS methods is that the observed data is generated by a system or process which is driven by a small number of latent (not directly observed or measured) variables. Projections of the observed data to its latent structure by means of PLS was developed by Herman Wold and coworkers [48,49,52].},

	abstract = {The technique of principal component analysis (PCA) has recently been expressed as the maximum likelihood solution for a generative latent variable model. In this paper we use this probabilistic reformulation as the basis for a Bayesian treatment of PCA. Our key result is that effective dimensionality of the latent space (equivalent to the number of retained principal components) can be determined automatically as part of the Bayesian inference procedure. An important application of this framework is to mixtures of probabilistic PCA models, in which each component can determine its own effective complexity.},
